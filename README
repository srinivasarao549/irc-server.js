irc-server.js
=============

An IRC server in Javascript. Inspired by the example IRCd Ryan
published here:

  https://gist.github.com/a3d0bbbff196af633995

Why?
----

Javascript is starting to break out of it's perceived roll as a
browser-based client-side-only language. I've been playing with node.js
for the past few weeks and it's rather nice. Trouble is, a lot of the
code that's been published so far isn't very well (or often, not at
all) tested. There's also a surprisingly small amount being published
as CommonJS modules. I like testing and I like CommonJS so I try to fix
these things.

Why an IRCd is particular? Well, IRC is a pretty satisfying way of
learning stuff - you get to see results with not too much effort, and
when it works it's easy to write bots for it which is quite fun.

Although it's not written yet, irc/server.js will be implemented as a
CommonJS[1] module. You'll use it something like this:

  var IRC = require("/path/to/irc/server.js"),
      sys    = require("sys");
  var server = new IRC.Server();
  server.run();


Simple, eh?

Eventually I'll expose a bunch of hooks, but for now I just want
somewhere for my bots to hang out that won't pollute public IRC
servers.

If there's something that it doesn't do that you want it to, please
feel free to fork and patch.

Contributing
------------

  * Fork the project.
  * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
  * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
    future version unintentionally.
  * Make sure all the tests pass.
  * Commit and push your changes.
  * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Testing
-------

We use my fork of spectacular[2] for testing. It's setup as a submodule
so you'll get it by running `git submodule init && git submodule update`
in the project directory.

Run the tests like this:

  cd /path/to/irc-server.js
  node vendor/spec/tacular.js

All tests must pass for a change to be committed to the master branch.
